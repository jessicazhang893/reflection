            <p>After reading “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?” I understand better the potential of what a website could be. For example, a website could be a “puddle,” in which case it may slowly evaporate—something I haven’t thought about before, because I see websites as more permanent. I have also never thought of websites as a rock falling deep into the ocean, because I always thought of websites as spaces of maintenance. It’s interesting to think about websites as digital architecture and the temporality of them, existing as a digital space that holds information but perhaps with a shifting or temporary purpose. Moreover, I haven’t thought deeply about the idea of the “cloud,” and how not everybody is connected to the web; it makes me question the privileges that people hold over others when it comes to the internet and its implications.</p>

            <p>What really struck me was Unindexed by Matthew Rothberg; I’ve never thought about the potential of a website self-destructing, since I’ve always thought of websites as having to serve a purpose. My interpretation of Unindexed is that it is a way of exploring the agency of a website and the transiency of content one may find on the internet. The term “handmade website” fascinates me—when I think about it, many experiences I’ve had with websites in the past are now nostalgic memories, introducing temporality. Being part of the generation that grew up alongside the growth of the internet, past web experiences hold a very different flavor, increasing feelings of nostalgia. Yet, I wonder if I will feel the same way towards current mainstream websites now that fulfill corporate purposes; perhaps these websites will, in their own way, feel nostalgic in the future, despite them being more impersonal. We think of these websites as intransient, but I think everything on the internet as some aspect of transiency to it. I also wonder how web designers can introduce a more personal and transient feel to corporate websites, or if slowness and transiency can only exist in avant-garde projects.</p>

            <h1>reflection three</h1>
            <p>The persisting comparison between computers and cities in “Hello World” by Taeyoon Choi really fascinated me. I’ve been thinking more about how digital spaces are like architecture, but now I better understand the differences; digital spaces are computed, while physical, urban spaces are unpredictable. Yet, I wonder if it’s true that digital spaces are computed and predictable; once a digital space is created, unpredictability could happen, just like how a city may be calculatively designed but unpredictable as culture complicates and shifts. We see code as something we have control over—but once the space is created and coded, we may not have full control anymore as human activity takes over. Moreover, the relation between art, architecture, abstraction, and computation interested me, since I see design as a cohesive idea formed by repetition. However, I wonder if we can fully represent computation or architecture through abstraction, as abstraction always leaves out specificity and other ideas.</p>
